    <div>
        Please choose how many tokens you want to return to Person A in case Person A does
        transfer his endowment and you receive 30 tokens. You can do this in integer amounts in
        steps of three tokens (i.e., 0, 3, â€¦, 27, 30). The tokens you do not return, you keep for
        yourself in addition to your initial endowment of 10 tokens.
    </div>
    <div>
        You need to take this decision 12 times because the Person A you are matched with can be
        from any of the 12 cities.
