        <p>
            Person B has to estimate whether or not the paired Person A transferred his initial endowment to her.
        <p>
            Since Person B at this moment does not know yet what city Person A is from, he will have to make his
            estimate
            for
            each of the 12 cities that are involved in this experiment.</p>

            Payoff calculation for Person B

    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
            Person B’s estimate whether or not his paired Person A will transfer his initial endowment to him is
            compared to
            the actual decision of Person A.
        </p>
        <p>
            The estimate is converted into a payoff according to the following rule:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If Person B estimates Person A’s decision correctly, Person B’s payoff for Part 2 is <b>10 Tokens</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If Person B estimates Person A’s decision incorrectly, Person B’s payoff for Part 2 is <b>0 Tokens</b>.
