            Estimation Task for Person A

        <p>
            Person A has to estimate how many Token the paired Person B will return <b>if</b> Person A would transfer his
            initial
            endowment, independently of whether Person A has <i>actually</i> transferred his endowment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since Person A at this moment does not know yet what city Person B is from, he will have to make his
            estimate
            for each of the 12 cities that are involved in this experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember: Before making her decision, Person B was not informed about whether Person A has actually
            transferred
            his endowment, or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, Person B had to decide how many out of the 30 Token she would have returned to Person A in case
            Person A had chosen to transfer his endowment to Person B.</p>
        <p>
            It is, therefore, possible for Person A to estimate the number of Token Person B has stated to return.

            Person A’s estimate of Person B’s return decision is compared with the actual return decision that the
