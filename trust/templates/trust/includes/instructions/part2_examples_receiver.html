<h5>Example 1:</h5>
<p>Suppose you are from City 6 in Region 6.</p>
<p>In Part 1, you decided to return 12 token in case Person A from City 2 transfers his endowment.</p>
<p>You are randomly paired with a participant A from City 2 in Region 2 who decided to transfer his endowment.</p>
<p>You estimated that Person A from City 2 will indeed transfer his endowment.</p>
<p>Your estimate is correct.</p>
<p>Your payoff in Part 2: 10</p>
<hr>
<h5>Example 2:</h5>
<p>Suppose you are from City 1 in Region 1.</p>
<p>In Part 1, you decided to return 18 token in case Person A from City 8 transfers his endowment.</p>
<p>You are randomly paired with a participant A from City 8 in Region 8 who decided NOT to transfer his endowment.</p>
<p>You estimated that Person A from City 8 will transfer his initial endowment.</p>
<p>Your estimate is NOT correct.</p>
<p>Your payoff in Part 2: 0</p>
