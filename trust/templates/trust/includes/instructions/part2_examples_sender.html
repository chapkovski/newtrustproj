<h5>Example 1:</h5>
<p>Suppose you are from City 2 in Region 2.</p>
<p>In Part 1, you decided to transfer your endowment to a Person B if this person is from City 6.</p>
<p>You are randomly paired with a Person B from City 6 in Region 6 who decided to return 12 Token in case he received the multiplied endowment of 30 Token from Person A in City 2.</p>
<p>You estimated that Person B from City 6 would return 15 Token.</p>
<p>The difference between your estimate and the actual decision of Person B is    15 – 12 = 3 Token.</p>
<p>Your payoff in Part 2: 10</p>
<hr>
<h5>Example 2:</h5>
<p>Suppose you are from City 8 in Region 8.</p>
<p>In Part 1, you decided NOT to transfer your endowment to a Person B if this person is from City 1.</p>
<p>You are randomly paired with a participant B from City 1 in Region 1 who decided to return 18 Token in case he received the multiplied endowment of 30 Token from Person A in City 8.</p>
<p>You estimated that Person B from City 1 would return 18 Token.</p>
<p>The difference between your estimate and the actual decision of Person B is    18 – 18 = 0 Token.</p>
<p>Your payoff: 20</p>
