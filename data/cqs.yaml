#"""
#procedure:
#
#Every player has a set of control questions attached.
#
#requirements:
#- have statistics per number of wrong answers for each question
#- switch between russian and english version
#- store the overall and part 1 and part 2 question wrong counter in player
#- change the validator message based on the number of attempts
#- let them through despite wrong answer after 3d attempt
#- show questions conditionally based on the stage (1,2) and role (sender,receiver - for stage 2).
#- modify form field/widget type (choices/number) based on question
#
#so we create from the dictionary below the
#questions for each player
#each cq instance contains a name field which is used a reference to this hardcoded structure.
#
#Strategy 1:
#cq incsntace: (player, cq_base, answer) -
#each time cq page is shown we let them create new instances with different properties.
#we collect the statistics via count the instances of one type
#
#Strategy 2:
#cq instance (player, cq_base, answer, count)
#we pre-create cq for each player, show them existing instances, without allowing them to add new ones.
#we validate them based on response and count, update the counter, return the validation error
#
#S2 sounds more promising
